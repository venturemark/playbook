# User Feedback

The user feedback playbook is for tracking quality perceived by users. An
Entepreneur or CEO might want to track the amount of quality a product or
service can deliver to its customers. Such information can be collected during
user feedback sessions so that perceived value can be recorded. This information
can be used as track record as well as community update.



### Interval

Implementing the user feedback playbook you may want to share progress at a
regular interval. Tracking a venture's quality of service can lead to increased
customer happiness, and thus more customers. You could create metric updates in
your timeline every day or every other day, depending on how often you
fascilitate your user feedback sessions.
