# Feature Development

The feature playbook is for tracking progress in feature development. A Software
Engineer or Product Manager might want to track the velocity of implemented
features in order to capture additional value. This information can be used as
track record as well as community update.



### Interval

Using the feature playbook you may want to find a regular interval at which you
want to share progress in your venture's feature development. You could create
metric updates in your timeline every week or every other week.



### Example

```
Over the past week we implemented 3 features as demanded by our community.

- Make documentation searchable.
- Make avatars updatable.
- Upload multiple files at once.
```
