# Recurring Revenue

The recurring revenue playbook is for tracking recurring revenue of your
venture. Keeping a track record of cash flow is a strong indicator for
successful startups. If you can prove that you got money in the bank, you are
destined to become a successful entrepreneur.



### Interval

regular interval. Tracking your cash flow should happen consistently at
predefined times in order to retain most accurate data. You could create metric
updates in your timeline every month for monthly recurring revenue. Creating

consistently e.g. on the 1st of every month.
