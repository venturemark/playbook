# Recurring Users

The recurring users playbook is for tracking recurring users of your product or
service. Keeping a track record of retention is a strong indicator for
successful startups. If you can prove that users come to you and stay, you are
destined to become a successful entrepreneur.



### Interval

Following the recurring users playbook you may want to share progress at a
regular interval. Tracking your retention should happen consistently at
predefined times in order to have most accuracy in your data. You could create
metric updates in your timeline every week for weekly recurring users. If you
prefer a monthly cadence you could track monthly recurring users by creating
metric updates always e.g. on the 1st of every month.



### Example

```
Weekly recurring users increased by 12% the third week in a row. We keep
crushing it!
```
