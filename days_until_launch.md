# Days Until Launch

The days until launch playbook is for tracking the amount of days left until you
launch your venture. Being able to predict accurately how many days are left
until you launch is an indicator for founders to understand well what they are
doing. Predicting reliably when to expect a certain goal reached is highly
appreciated by VCs, because it makes it easier to invest into a venture that can
reduce uncertainty by a high margin.



### Interval

Following the days until launch playbook you may want to keep your audience up
to date about the estimated availability of your product or service. It would be
beneficial to chose a regular interval so that it becomes clear if you are able
to reliably predict reaching your goals over extended periods of time. You could
create metric updates in your timeline every day or every other day, depending
on the impact of challenges you are facing.



### Example

```
Our ETA holds true and we are on track to launch in 14 days. Crossing
fingers!
